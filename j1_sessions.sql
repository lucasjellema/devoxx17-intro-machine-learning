In JDK 9, HarfBuzz is used for text layout, replacing the long-standing use of the deprecated layout component of the ICU library. This gives Java 2D and Swing applications a modern, secure, performant, up-to-date library with better script and font support and better support for advanced typography. This work was done to implement JEP 258 in OpenJDK. This BOF session compares and contrasts its impact on applications, especially emphasizing new-feature support.

This session explores the use of higher-rank and higher-kinded types and shows how they can provide new guarantees at compile time. We can disallow side effects in calls to software transactional memory (STM). We can make sure that JavaFX components are ever touched only in the UI thread. We can assert that parallel computations change no state.

It starts at the very beginning: how to write a lambda from an instance of an anonymous class. Then it shows some of the new methods added to the Collection API that leverage lambdas and default methods in interfaces, allowing for the addition of new methods while improving performance. The presentation also covers how functional interfaces have been used to create new APIs, mainly on real examples from the JDK. Finally, it shows how well-known patterns can be implemented with lambdas, leading to cleaner and more robust code.','José Paumard','Core Java Platform','Tutorial','Introductory');

Most often that will be a collector, a new kind of operation invented for the Streams API. To use streams effectively, you need to understand how collectors work, what predefined collectors are available, and the factors that affect collector performance. This deep dive into the Collectors API explores the many predefined collectors and how to combine them for added power. You’ll do practical work, learning how to choose the right composition of collectors to solve practical programming problems.

The latest release helps drive this change. Conventional Java has made inroads into the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by providing gateway functionality but cannot meet the requirements of edge analytics and system control, which require real-time response. RTSJ 2.0 bridges the gap between the requirements of the internet and device programming to produce secure, dynamic embedded systems. The RTSJ refines the semantics of the Java virtual machine and adds APIs necessary for real-time applications while retaining full compatibility with conventional Java programs.

Java 9, like its predecessors, has a bunch of great new APIs and language features, but developers remembering past experiences need to know how to use those new features without breaking compatibility with earlier versions of Java. Java 9’s designers are aware of this, and they’ve worked hard to make new features accessible to developers who have to think about their applications’ support of older versions of Java. In this session, learn about Java 9 features that are ready to use even if you have an older application and that ensure that customers can run your application with ease.','Wayne Citrin','Java Development Tools','BOF (Birds-of-a-Feather) Session','Advanced');

What are the challenges for library developers? Still supporting 1.6? What about this (pre-)modular design where you have common packages across different JARs? Multirelease JARs, anyone?

Value Types give us a way to specify custom data types with primitive-like characteristics. Machine Code Snippets give JVM implementers the ability to quickly add native-level operations at the library level via MethodHandle bindings.

The origins of lambda expressions go back 80 years, well before Java (and even modern computing) started. They are based on the work of Alonso Church, who created lambda calculus as a mathematical model of computation. The session concludes by exploring how, using only one new functional interface, we can (in theory) solve any problem by using only lambda expressions.  This really is Java, but most of it won’t look like any code you’ve ever seen.

Come to this session to get answers to these questions, to learn how to work with OpenJ9 alongside the OpenJDK class libraries, and to gauge for yourself whether OpenJ9 is something that could help you and your development teams.','Steve Wallin','Core Java Platform','Conference Session','Introductory');

The projector pattern offers an efficient way to construct ambitious UIs from presentation models that capture “what” to display. The projector defines in a single and consistent way “how” to visualize the model and how to interact with it. The programmer just selects projections such as “simple form,” “master-detail,” and “search” from a catalog. Suitable projectors display this declarative UI with your UI toolkit of choice, be it desktop (JavaFX, Swing, SWT), web, or mobile.

The two speakers take turns playing good cop/bad cop on each feature, and <i>you</i> can vote on which features are important to you. The energetic session cuts through the hype to outline how Java 9 will realistically affect the everyday pragmatic developer. You’ll learn what’s in the Java 9 release and how you can benefit from what’s new in Java.','Simon Maple','Core Java Platform','Conference Session','Introductory');

They have a direct impact on the resulting code, and its implementation can go in many different directions. How do you choose the best route to go? How do you guarantee consistency and performance across the framework? In this session, the mastermind behind Eclipse Collections (and previously GS Collections) shares the design choices he had to face and how he did it, the impact on different implementation strategies, and how the framework became a Eclipse project. Come take a look behind the curtains of a widely used API that has many years of development and that you can contribute to.','Nikhil Nanivadekar','Core Java Platform','Conference Session','Advanced');

And what if it could be scheduled and scaled with a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes? You could share the same repeatable dev environment with your whole team. You could run it in the cloud and scale it as needed. Unfortunately, that’s not something that can be done with any old Java IDE. The IDE needs to have been designed from the ground up to run in the cloud. Luckily, such an IDE exists: it’s an open source Eclipse project called Che. This session takes a look at Che, the benefits of running an IDE in the cloud, and the work the speaker’s company did to make Che, a web app written in Java, run on Kubernetes.','Mario Loriedo','Java Development Tools','Conference Session','Intermediate');

It discusses how Scala can succeed in a highly regulated, generally risk-averse environment and why it can be worth that risk and lead to a happier, healthier team. Still not sure if this session will be worth your time? You might enjoy it if you believe in Life Beyond Java but the rest of your team thinks that Java 8 lambdas killed Scala and you are looking for moral support. On the other hand, the session may be less relevant for you if you believe that Java 8 lambdas killed Scala and you’re tired of hearing from that one teammate who keeps trying to convince you otherwise.','Sten Anderson','Emerging Languages','Conference Session','Introductory');

Specifications promise infinite flexibility, habitually give old concepts new names, offer endless extensions, and almost seem designed to deliberately confuse. With an eye on architecturual impact, actual HTTP messages, and aggressive distaste for fancy terminology, this session delves into OAuth 2.0 as it pertains to REST and shows how it falls into two camps: stateful and stateless. It then explores a competing Amazon-style approach called HTTP Signatures, ideal for B2B APIs. Finally, it discusses a new internet draft launched this year that combines them both into the perfect two-factor system that could provide a one-stop shop for business as well as mobile REST scenarios.','David Blevins','Java, Cloud, and Server-Side Development','Conference Session','Introductory');
